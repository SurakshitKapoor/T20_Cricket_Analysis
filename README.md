# T20_Cricket_Analysis
This is a full-fledged T20 Cricket Analysis project using Python and Power BI. We used Python for cleaning raw json data and converting to csv format, with its  manipulation. In PowerBI, we did transforming of data, data modelling, then finally we delivered super user-interactive dashboards to visualize the whole match in graphical form.
